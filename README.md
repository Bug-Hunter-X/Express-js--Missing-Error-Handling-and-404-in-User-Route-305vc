# Express.js Error Handling and 404 Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling for database interactions and the lack of a 404 response for missing resources.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code with improved error handling and a 404 response when a user is not found.

## Bug Description

The original code fails to handle errors properly during database lookups.  It also doesn't provide a proper 404 response when a user with the specified ID is not found. This can lead to cryptic error messages or unexpected application behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves adding more robust error handling using try-catch blocks and explicitly handling the scenario where a user is not found, returning a 404 status code.
